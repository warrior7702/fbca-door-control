## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Glassmorphism Design ✨
- **What it is:** Frosted glass effect with backdrop blur
- **Why it matters:** Modern 2024-2026 design trend (Apple-inspired)
- **Effect:** Cards appear to float above gradient background
- **Technical:** `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` + semi-transparent backgrounds

### 2. Professional Color System 🎨
- **Custom gradient palette:** Blue→Purple (primary), Teal→Green (success), etc.
- **Church-appropriate:** Professional, trustworthy, not flashy
- **Consistent:** Used throughout all components
- **Accessible:** WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios

### 3. Smooth Animations 🌊
- **Entrance:** Cards fade in and slide up (0.6s)
- **Hover:** Buttons lift with shadow increase (0.3s)
- **Click:** Ripple effect expands across buttons (0.6s)

- **Performance:** GPU-accelerated (transform + opacity only)

### 4. Modern Typography ✍️
- **Font:** Inter (modern, readable, professional)
- **Hierarchy:** Clear sizing and weight system
- **Spacing:** Generous whitespace improves readability
- **Polish:** Letter-spacing on uppercase labels

### 5. Enhanced Visual Hierarchy 📊
- **Large stat numbers** (1.75rem, bold) draw attention
- **Gradient badges** create visual interest
- **Icon labels** (emojis) provide quick recognition

### 6. Responsive Design 📱
- **Desktop Large (>1200px):** Full 3-column layout
- **Desktop (992-1199px):** Optimized spacing
- **Tablet (768-991px):** Icon-only buttons, 2-column
- **Mobile (<768px):** Single column, touch-friendly
- **Tested:** All breakpoints verified

### 7. Accessibility Improvements ♿
- **Keyboard navigation:** Tab through all controls
- **Focus visible:** Blue glow outline on focus
